    shortDescr = Make KipEng Universal Docking Ports passable
    longDescr = KipEng Universal Docking Ports are by default not passable Connected Living Spaces parts. This mostly makes sense because to allow docking with multiple size ports, they can't really open. But I don't like that and want a simple, passable port.
